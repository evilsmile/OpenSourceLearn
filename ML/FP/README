The FP-growth algorithm is an efficient way of finding frequent patters in a dataset.
The FP-growth algorithm works with the Apriori principle but is much faster. The 
Apriori algorithm generates candidate itemsets and then scans the dataset to see if
they're frequent. FP-growth is faster because it goes over the database only twice. 
The database is stored in a structure called an FP-tree, After the FP-tree is built, 
you can find frequent itesmsets by find conditional bases for an item and bulding a 
conditional FP-tree. This process is repeated, conditioning on more items untils the 
conditional FP-tree has only one item.

   The FP-growth algorithm can be used to find frequent words in a series of text
documents. There are a number of uses for frequent itemset generation such as 
shopping transactions, medical diagnosis, and study of the atmosphere.
